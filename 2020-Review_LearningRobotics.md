## 1. Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive review of how robotics can benefit from learning techniques.  
It introduces major paradigms such as supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and imitation learning,  
and highlights their applications in robotic perception, control, and planning.

---

## 2. Key Concepts
- **Supervised Learning**: Label-based training, often used in perception tasks (e.g., object recognition).
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Agents learn by trial and error to maximize rewards.
- **Imitation Learning**: Robots learn behaviors from expert demonstrations.
- **Sim2Real**: Bridging the gap between simulation and real-world performance.

---

## 3. What I Learned
- Learning in robotics is not just for high-level intelligence, but also for **low-level control**.
- The **combination** of learning and classical control is a current trend.
- I was interested in the use of **deep reinforcement learning** for dynamic tasks like locomotion.

---

## 4. Questions I Still Have
- How to efficiently collect real-world training data?
- How do we measure learning performance in real robots?
- What are the limitations of current imitation learning models?

---

## 5. Ideas or Follow-up
- Try reading a paper on sim2real transfer techniques.
- Maybe test imitation learning with a simple robot in simulation (Unity?).
